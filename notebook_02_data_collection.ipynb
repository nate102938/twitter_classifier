    "- This notebook uses the Tweepy package to download tweets for specified accounts from the Twitter API. In order to use the API, you need your own bearer key, which serves as your authentication into the API.  If you are planning to use the API, put your bearer key into the variable 'bearer_key' in the constants section.\n",
    "- It uses a manually created account list file (accounts.csv) which has all of the Twitter handles to download tweets from, the class to assign to each handle, and how many tweets to get download from each handle.  \n",
    "- The accounts file is important to keep current in order to avoid downloading tweets from the same account multiple times as users of the Twitter API are limited to the number of tweets that can be pulled in a one month time period.  As such, when tweets for a particular handle are downloaded, the tweets are immediately appended to a tweets CSV file (tweet_list.csv) and the accounts file is updated to mark that handle as 'done'.
